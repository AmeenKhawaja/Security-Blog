                        From a young age I've always been deeply interested in computers and how they operated. 
                        Being introduced to computers from a very young age sparked my interest in them. I can always 
                        remember the feeling of wanting to know how computers worked, why they worked, and what 
                        else they could do. Now, I'm a second year Computer Science student at Brock University with a passion
                        in coding and gaming. My favourite language to code in is Java, followed by Python.
